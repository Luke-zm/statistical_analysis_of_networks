If you do the coding in a separate place and only store the results in this notebook, you will not get any partial points in case your answer is wrong, so I encourage you to add the full code to this notebook. **Make sure the whole Jupyter Notebook runs without errors before submitting**. You can check this by pressing _Run All_ in the menu.\n",
